# Nexus | Unified Business Intelligence

> **Stop Managing Chaos. Start Orchestrating Growth.**
> Nexus is an open architectural blueprint for a unified dashboard that brings all your online businesses, analytics, and tasks into a single, AI-powered command center.

## The Vision 🚀

Entrepreneurs and solopreneurs are drowning in tabs: Google Analytics, Shopify, WordPress, ad platforms, support tickets. Context switching is killing productivity.

Nexus envisions a **central nervous system for your digital empire**. It doesn't aim to replace your tools but to **orchestrate them**, providing a holistic view and actionable insights you can't get anywhere else.

## What This Repository Is (And Isn't)

| ✅ This IS: | ❌ This IS NOT: |
| :--- | :--- |
| A **public specification** and vision document. | A fully-built, ready-to-install commercial product. |
| A collection of **open-source prototypes** and core modules. | A proprietary, closed-source system. |
| A **living roadmap** for a new approach to business intelligence. | A feature-complete application. |
| An **invitation to collaborate** on defining the future. | A solo project; we believe in building in the open. |

## Core Philosophy

1.  **Unification, Not Replacement:** Plug into your existing stack.
2.  **AI-Native, Not AI-Bolted:** Intelligence is the core, not a feature.
3.  **Privacy-First:** Your data belongs to you. Self-hostable.
4.  **Composable Architecture:** Pick the modules you need.

## Current Status: Phase 1

We are in active design and prototyping. Perfect time to get involved.

**What's here now:**
- Specification document
