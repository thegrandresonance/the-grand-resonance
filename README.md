# Nexus | Unified Business Intelligence

> **Stop Managing Chaos. Start Orchestrating Growth.**
> Nexus is an open architectural blueprint for a unified dashboard that brings all your online businesses, analytics, and tasks into a single, AI-powered command center.

## The Vision 🚀

Entrepreneurs and solopreneurs are drowning in tabs: Google Analytics, Shopify, WordPress, ad platforms, support tickets. Context switching is killing productivity.

Nexus envisions a **central nervous system for your digital empire**. It doesn't aim to replace your tools but to **orchestrate them**, providing a holistic view and actionable insights you can't get anywhere else.

## What This Repository Is (And Isn't)

| ✅ This IS:                                                                                              | ❌ This IS NOT:                                       |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| A **public specification** and vision document.                                                         | A fully-built, ready-to-install commercial product. |
| A collection of **open-source prototypes** and core modules (see `/prototypes`).                      | A proprietary, closed-source system.                  |
| A **living roadmap** for a new approach to business intelligence.                                       | A feature-complete application.                     |
| An **invitation to collaborate** on defining the future of this tool.                                   | A solo project; we believe in building in the open.   |

## Core Philosophy & Principles

1.  **Unification, Not Replacement:** Plug into your existing stack. We build connectors, not competitors.
2.  **AI-Native, Not AI-Bolted:** Intelligence is the core, not a feature. Proactive alerts, automated summaries, and predictive insights.
3.  **Privacy-First:** Your data belongs to you. Nexus can be self-hosted. We don't want your data; we want to help you understand it.
4.  **Composable Architecture:** Pick the modules you need. E-commerce analytics? Content performance? Project management? Enable what matters to you.
