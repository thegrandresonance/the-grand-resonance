# Nexus Technical Specification v1.0

## Project Overview
Nexus is a unified dashboard that helps business owners manage all their online stores and services from one place.

## What Problem We Solve
Business owners waste time switching between different apps like Shopify, WordPress, and Google Analytics. Nexus brings everything together in one dashboard.

## Main Features

### For Business Owners
- See all business numbers in one place
- Get alerts when something needs attention
- Connect all your stores and services easily

### For Developers
- Clean, modern code that's easy to work with
- Well-documented APIs
- Modular design - use only what you need

## Technical Plan

### Phase 1 - Basic Dashboard
1. Create main dashboard layout
2. Connect to Shopify API
3. Show basic sales numbers
4. Simple user login system

### Phase 2 - Smart Features  
1. Add alert system for problems
2. Connect more platforms (WordPress, Stripe)
3. Basic trend analysis

### Phase 3 - Advanced AI
1. Predictive analytics
2. Automated recommendations
3. Custom reporting

## Files We'll Create
- `dashboard.html` - Main user interface
- `api-connector.js` - Handles connections to other services
- `database.js` - Stores user data and settings
- `styles.css` - Makes everything look good

## Simple Explanation for Non-Technical People
Think of Nexus as a "mission control center" for your online businesses. Instead of checking 10 different apps, you see everything in one screen.

## For Technical People
We'll use modern web technologies and focus on security and performance from day one.

## Next Steps
1. Build the basic dashboard layout
2. Test with one platform (Shopify)
3. Get feedback from early users
4. Improve based on what people need
